How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped me see where changes were made and that enabled me easily find the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    The ability to view previous versions of a file is pertinent to the success of a programmer because it helps him/her in knowing exactly where things started going wrong.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The difference is that manually saved commits is more flexible and the developer can breakdown the commits into logical checkpoints as opposed to google doc's auto save which can make gibberish out of code checkpoints.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because changes in code can span across different files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log allows you to see all commits and their authors whiles git diff helps you compare two files/commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You could easily go back to when the code actually worked(git checkout).

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
