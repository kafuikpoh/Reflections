When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-remote repositories are used mainly for collaboration.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-a fork is like a clone of a repository but its done completely on GitHub servers, from one repo to another. Clones are copies of GitHub repos on local machines.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-so you can know if the remote has any new changes
